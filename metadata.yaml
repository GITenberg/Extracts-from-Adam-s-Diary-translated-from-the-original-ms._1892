description: In this short 1904 work, from late in his career, Mark Twain imagines
  how Adam was introduced to Eve. This new creature with the long hair is a good deal
  in the way. It is always hanging around and following me about. I don't like this;
  I am not used to company..." Twain also published a companion volume, Eve's Diary
  .
